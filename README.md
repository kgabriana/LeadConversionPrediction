Lead Conversion Prediction for EdTech Startup

Predicting Customer Conversion with Machine Learning

Overview

This project explores lead conversion prediction for an EdTech startup using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify potential customers most likely to convert, allowing the company to allocate marketing resources efficiently.

Key Features

	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identified key trends and conversion drivers
	•	Feature Engineering – Created engagement metrics and handled skewed data
	•	Machine Learning Models – Built and optimized Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost
	•	Model Tuning – Used GridSearchCV to improve predictive accuracy
	•	Business Insights – Provided actionable recommendations for improving conversion rates

Tech Stack

	•	Languages: Python
	•	Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP
	•	Tools: Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab), GitHub

Dataset

The dataset includes customer interactions such as website visits, time spent, and referral sources. Due to privacy, the dataset is not included in this repository.

Results

	•	Random Forest & XGBoost had the best balance of accuracy and interpretability.
	•	Website engagement and profile completion were the most critical conversion factors.
	•	Mobile app leads converted less frequently, suggesting UX improvements are needed.
	•	Referral programs had high conversion rates, though underutilized.

Next Steps

	•	Deploy the model as an API for real-time lead scoring.
	•	Optimize marketing efforts based on model insights.
